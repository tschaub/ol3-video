This is a quick ripoff of [Mapbox's cool GL video demo](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/video-in-mapbox-gl/).

As a very rough hack, there are some things left undone:

 - [ ] ask for permission
 - [ ] handle map rotation
 - [ ] figure out why the video footprint doesn't transform quite right
 - [ ] create `ol.source.Video` to make this less of a hack
 - [ ] provide a nice playback control
